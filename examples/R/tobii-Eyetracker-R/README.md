Tobii Eyetracker in R
=====================

Just a small test to plot the data exported by the tobii eyetracker in R

- Go to [r-project.org/](http://www.r-project.org/)  
- download and install R for your OS from one of the servers  

##Mac OSX  

Open a Terminal window and enter the follwing code (This creates an R envoirment file in your home directory)  

    echo "R_LIBS=/Users/$HOME/rLibrary" > $HOME/.Renviron

Creates a folder called "rLibrary" in your homefolder. All installed libraries will go there. Type:  

    mkdir ~/rLibrary  

###Start R.app from your Applications folder  
in the R console. Check your current working directory by entering:  

    getwd()  

The result should point to your home folder.  

####Set your working directory to somewhere where you can remember.
e.g the Desktop or whereever you cloned this repo.  

    setwd("/Users/[YOUR USER NAME]/Desktop/tobii-Eyetracker-R")  

Now you can place files in there and read them with R.  

Open the eyetracker.R with the R.app.  
Select the lines you want to execute  

select:  

    data <- read.table("tobii-CSVExport-All-Data-noheader-nofilter.tsv",sep="\t", header=TRUE)
    # plot(data$GazePointX,data$GazePointY, main="eyetracker", sub="",xlab="X-axis GazePointX", ylab="GazePointY", ylim=c(1024,0), xlim=c(0,1280))
    # png(filename="out.png", width = 1280, height = 1024,)
    par(bg = 'black')
    plot(data$GazePointX,data$GazePointY, sub="", xlab="", ylab="",axes=FALSE, ylim=c(1024,0), xlim=c(0,1280),col="black")
    points(data$GazePointX,data$GazePointY, col = "green", cex = .6)
    lines(data$GazePointX,data$GazePointY, col = "white")

hit cmd + enter. This should open a window with your plot that looks like this:
