# LiquidTraffic (RCC Hack)
----------------------------------
This arduino sketch was written to create a mechatronical data visualization. Therefore it reads signals from an remote controlled car and handles an servomotor.

If the arduino receives forward signals, it moves the servomotor so that the ferroliquid is stronger influenced by the magnetic field, if it receives backward signals it reduces the influence.

## Info

This student research project was created in context of the course [Eingabe, Ausgabe. Grundlagen der prozessorientierten Gestaltung](https://incom.org/workspace/5122) at [University of Applied Sciences Potsdam](http://design.fh-potsdam.de).
