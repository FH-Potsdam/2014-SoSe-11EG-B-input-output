# EyeTracking Sculpture
----------------------------------
This processing sketch creates a three dimensional object from eyetracking data.

The x- and y-axis correspond with the image axis, the z-axis depends on the fixation duration of a gaze point. The longer fixation duration was, the deeper the point is rendered.
